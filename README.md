# Film Den Website
For 2019 I would like to create a website, a good website using a high amount of front-end development.<br/>
Currently I'm thinking of making it a movie website, similar to IMDb. <br/>
Currently it's in the early stage of development, the very early. But in the future I do wish to make it better. <br/>

<b>Using:</b>
- languages: HTML5 and CSS3
- IDE: Atom

<b>To Do:</b>
- import the database
- add the first PHP file
- plan out the design
- add more and more files
